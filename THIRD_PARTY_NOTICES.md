# Third-party notices

ytnabber launches the following separate engine executables. They are not linked into its Rust binary.

- **yt-dlp 2026.10.26**: yt-dlp's source is under the Unlicense. The official PyInstaller Windows executable includes GPLv3+ code and is distributed under GPLv3+ as a combined work. See licenses/yt-dlp.txt, licenses/yt-dlp-third-party.txt and licenses/GPL-3.0.txt.
- **Deno 2.9.8**: MIT, with additional third-party components documented in its upstream source. See licenses/deno.txt.
- **FFmpeg 9.0.2**: LGPL 2.1 or later, built from official source with the pinned Microsoft vcpkg recipes in scripts/ffmpeg. FFmpeg and FFprobe share replaceable DLLs; GPL and nonfree features are disabled. See licenses/ffmpeg-lgpl.txt and engines/licenses/ffmpeg.txt. The bundled LAME, Opus, OpenH264, libvpx, dav1d and zlib license texts are also in engines/licenses/.
- **Tauri, Vite, TypeScript and Rust dependencies**: license metadata is available in their published packages and the committed dependency lockfiles.

Exact corresponding upstream source and build-material locations are listed in licenses/SOURCES.md. All licenses in that directory accompany the installer. The separate engines and shared libraries can be replaced by compatible versions in the installed engines directory; ytnabber does not modify or restrict their replacement.

The supplied emblem and application logo were provided by the project owner. No license to those assets is implied.
