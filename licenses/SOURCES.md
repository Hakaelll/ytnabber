# Corresponding source and build materials

yt-dlp and Deno downloads are pinned, unmodified upstream release assets. Their exact URLs and SHA-256 values are recorded in scripts/engine-manifest.json and the installed engines/versions.json. FFmpeg is built from verified upstream sources as described below.

## yt-dlp 2026.10.26

- [Release and source tarball](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/tag/2026.10.26)
- [Exact tagged source](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/tree/2026.10.26)
- [Windows executable build materials](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/tree/2026.10.26/bundle)
- [Build workflow and dependency versions](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/tree/2026.10.26/.github/workflows)
- [Dependency lockfile](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/2026.10.26/uv.lock)
- [Bundled third-party notices](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/2026.10.26/THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt)

The upstream Windows binary is a GPLv3+ combined work; the source repository alone is Unlicense. Its notices identify the included components and their licenses.

## FFmpeg 9.0.2, compact LGPL shared build

- [Exact FFmpeg source](https://github.com/FFmpeg/FFmpeg/tree/n9.0.2)
- [Pinned vcpkg registry, source hashes and patches](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/d4c0a46cb8f63e5c9fa007d13baf1cb3e43bf7e3/ports)
- [FFmpeg port and applied patches](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg/tree/d4c0a46cb8f63e5c9fa007d13baf1cb3e43bf7e3/ports/ffmpeg)
- App build recipe: scripts/ffmpeg/vcpkg.json, scripts/ffmpeg/triplets/x64-ytnabber.cmake and scripts/build-ffmpeg.mjs in this release's source.

The LGPL 2.1+ shared build uses replaceable DLLs and the static Microsoft CRT. GPL/nonfree features, FFplay and external GPU/filter packages are not enabled; none are called by YTNabber's download or conversion profiles. Core decoders, containers, native device inputs including lavfi, HTTPS via Windows Schannel, MP3/AAC/Opus encoding and OpenH264 remain enabled. Run engines/ffmpeg.exe -buildconf to inspect the exact configuration. The installed engines/ffmpeg-build.json records the recipe, configuration and binary hashes; engines/checksums.json records every distributed engine resource.

The pinned registry also contains the exact source URLs, cryptographic hashes and build patches for LAME, Opus, OpenH264, libvpx, dav1d and zlib. Their target-package copyright files are distributed in engines/licenses/. All source/build materials above are available without charge. Build tools and source caches are not part of the installed application.

## Deno 2.9.8

- [Exact source and third-party material](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/v2.9.8)
- [Deno license](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/v2.9.8/LICENSE.md)
- [Releases](https://github.com/denoland/deno/releases/tag/v2.9.8)

## Application dependencies

package-lock.json and src-tauri/Cargo.lock record the exact JavaScript and Rust dependencies. Their source packages include individual license metadata. The repository's versioned source and Git history identify the build materials; publishing a GitHub release/tag is a separate distribution step.
